const clientId = process.env.CLIENT_ID || "";
const clientSecret = process.env.CLIENT_SECRET || "";

(async () => {
  const api = new HostawayApi(clientId, clientSecret);
  const accessToken = await api.getAccessToken();
  api.authenticate(accessToken);
  const pms = new HostawayClient(api);

  // List all guests
  const guests = await pms.getGuests(100, 0);
  console.log(guests);

  // Get guest by ID
  const guest = await pms.getGuestById(1);
  console.log(guest);

  // Create a new guest
  const newGuest = await pms.createGuest({ name: "Juan" });
  console.log(newGuest);

  // Update a guest
  const updatedGuest = await pms.updateGuest(1, { name: "Juan Carlos" });
  console.log(updatedGuest);

  // Delete a guest
